# PythonImageClassifierApp

This repo is a light-weight micro-service app that allows users to upload an image and have any objects or faces recognized. The application uses Keras with a TensorFlow back-end for the core classification. Flask is used for the REST API. Bootstrap is used as the front-end interface.

For the front-end I used the tutorial created by Traversy Media as the basis. See tutorial series "Python Flask From Scratch" on YouTube.

To run the application use:

python app.py
